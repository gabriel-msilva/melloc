Fractals are a beautifully complex -- and I usually do not use these words together -- topic in Mathematics.
Among many conceptual disagreements between mathematicians, at some point 
[Benoit Mendelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot) proposed a simple and approachable definition:

> A fractal is a shape made of parts similar to the whole in some way.

Figure \@ref(fig:sierpinski-triangle) illustrates this.
You could painstakingly count how many triangles do you see to measure your IQ in some online test, but let's look at some properties of this shape.

```{r sierpinski-triangle, out.width="80%", fig.link=fig_links$static["sierpinski_triangle"], fig.cap="A simple example of a fractal, called Sierpiński triangle. The triangular patterns repeat over and over in smaller scales."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$static["sierpinski_triangle"])
```

We notice that the main equilateral triangle repeats itself into many other smaller triangles.
More formally, this property is called [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity),
when parts of a shape have exactly or approximately similar parts of itself ("the whole").
This is observed by zooming into the shape, just to find the same patterns again.

Despite the figure presenting a limited number of triangles,
you could easily extrapolate the shape at arbitrarily smaller scales by understanding the repeating pattern, the *rule* used to create this shape.
Maybe something like:

  1. Start with an equilateral triangle of any size;
  2. Inscribe another equilateral triangle into it and remove this area;
  3. Repeat step 2 for each triangle formed

Figure \@ref(fig:sierpinski-triangle) illustrates the first iterations Notice that this set of rules does not [halt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem), *i.e.* it goes on indefinitely.
If you did not stop drawing this pattern, you would obtain a fractal called [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle).

```{r sierpinski-steps, fig.link=fig_links$static["sierpinski_steps"], fig.cap="First iterations to build a Sierpiński triangle."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$static["sierpinski_steps"])
```

This a simple example of a fractal.
There are many others that create more complex patterns, but not necessarily by much more complex rules.
[Gaston Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Julia) and Benoit Mendelbrot were influential mathematicians in fractal geometry, well-known for the sets which take their names.


## Mandelbrot set

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers $c = x + yi$ for which the sequence

$$
z_{n + 1} = z_n^2 + c, \quad z_0 = 0
$$

does not diverge as $n$ grows. For example, when $c = 1$,

\begin{alignat}{4}
  z_0 &=&     &     &  0 \\
  z_1 &=& 0^2 & +1 =&  1 \\
  z_2 &=& 1^2 & +1 =&  2 \\
  z_3 &=& 2^2 & +1 =&  5 \\
  z_4 &=& 5^2 & +1 =& 26 \\
      & \dots            \\
\end{alignat}

We can see that $|z_n| \rightarrow \infty$ when $n \rightarrow \infty$ and thus $c = 1$ is *not* part of the Mandelbrot set.
On the other hand, for $c = -1$, $z_n$ oscillates between $-1$ and $0$, *i.e.* it remains *bounded*, so it belongs to the set.

\begin{alignat}{4}
  z_0 &=&        &     &   0 \\
  z_1 &=& 0^2    & -1 =& -1 \\
  z_2 &=& (-1)^2 & -1 =&  0 \\
  z_3 &=& 0^2    & -1 =& -1 \\
  z_4 &=& (-1)^2 & -1 =&  0 \\
      & \dots               \\
\end{alignat}

For the boundary $|z| \leq 2$ ($|z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so a circle in the complex plane), the Mandelbrot set looks like Figure \@ref(fig:mandelbrot-bw).
We are looking at $c$ points for which $|z_n| \leq 2$ for every $n = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 100\}$ iteration. 

```{r mandelbrot-bw, fig.link=fig_links$static["mandelbrot_bw"], fig.cap="The Mandelbrot set for 100 iterations."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$static["mandelbrot_bw"])
```

It also interesting to see *how many iterations* does it take for $z_n$ to escape the boundary.
For $c = -0.8 + 0.5i$ in Figure \@ref(fig:z-escape), $z$ takes $n = 6$ iterations to escape the boundary.

```{r z-escape, fig.cap="For $c = -0.8+ 0.5i$, $z$ escapes the boundary $|z| \\leq 2$ at the 6th iteration."}
quadratic_map(0, -.8 + .5i, max_iter = 6L) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Re(z), y = Im(z))) +
  ggforce::geom_circle(
    aes(x0 = 0, y0 = 0, r = 2), 
    fill = "gray80",
    color = "gray80",
    alpha = 0.10,
    inherit.aes	= FALSE
    ) +
  geom_path()  + 
  geom_label(aes(label = paste0("z[", iter, "]"), color = abs(z) <= 2), 
             size=9, parse = TRUE) +
  coord_equal(x = c(-3, 3), y = c(-3, 3)) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        text = element_text(family = "Merriweather", size = 28, color = "gray30"))
```

If we map this iteration count to the color aesthetic of each point $c$, we get Figure \@ref(fig:mandelbrot-colored).

```{r mandelbrot-colored, fig.link=fig_links$static["mandelbrot_colored"], fig.cap="Colored Mandelbrot set for 100 iterations, where the color represents the iteration $n$ when $|z_n| > 2$."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$static["mandelbrot_colored"])
```

But where is the self-similarity? We need to zoom-in to see it better – and there are many “hidden” repeating patterns inside the Mandelbrot set.
Figure \@ref(fig:mandelbrot-zoom) focus on one of these, but you probably can spot other across the way.

```{r mandelbrot-zoom, fig.link=fig_links$animated["mandelbrot_zoom"], fig.cap="Self-similarity in the Mandelbrot set."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$animated["mandelbrot_zoom"])
```

Actually, the colored Mandelbrot is not so smooth as can be seen on Figure \@ref(fig:mandelbrot-colored).
It creates "bands of color" as in Figure \@ref(fig:mandelbrot-smoothing)a, because the iteration count is a natural number.
The *continuous* coloring (Figure \@ref(fig:mandelbrot-smoothing)b) is obtained by applying an
[algorithm called "normalized iteration  count"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set#Continuous_(smooth)_coloring),
which adds $\delta \in [0, 1[$ to iteration count as function of $|z|$.

```{r mandelbrot-smoothing, fig.link=fig_links$static["mandelbrot_smoothing"], fig.cap="Continuous (smooth) coloring on the Mandelbrot set."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$static["mandelbrot_smoothing"])
```

## Julia set

Similarly to the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set is the set of complex numbers $z$ for which the recursive function

$$
R(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}
$$

does not diverge (or escapes a boundary) for a increasing number of iterations. $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials without common divisors.
Consider a particular Julia set where $R(z) = z^2 + c$, then we have an equation analogous to the *logistic mapping* of the Mandelbrot set

$$
z_{n + 1} = z_n^2 + c
$$

but for a fixed complex $c$ instead of a fixed $z_0$. In the same manner, we will count how many iterations does it take for $z_n$ to escape the boundary $|z| \leq 2$ for a given $c$.
Figure \@ref(fig:julia-set) shows this particular Julia set for two values of $c$.

```{r julia-set, fig.link=fig_links$static[["julia_set"]], fig.cap="Quadractic Julia sets for (a) $c = -1$ and (b) $c = i$ with 200 iterations."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$static[["julia_set"]])
```

The Julia set also has many self-similarities, as illustrated by Figure \@ref(fig:julia-zoom).

```{r julia-zoom, fig.link=fig_links$animated["julia_zoom"], fig.cap="Zooming in point $z \\approx 1.618$ of the Julia set $J_c(z) = z^2 + c$ for $c = -1$."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$animated["julia_zoom"])
```


## Relation between Mandelbrot and Julia sets

While Mandelbrot set is mapped into $z$ complex plane, Julia set is mapped into $c$ complex plane.
So, for each point of the Mandelbrot set there is a corresponding Julia set, and vice-versa.
Figure \@ref(fig:julia-segment) shows this correspondence along a line segment on the Mandelbrot set.

```{r julia-segment, fig.link=fig_links$animated["julia_segment"], fig.cap="Julia sets $J_c(f)$ along the line segment $c = ai, -1 \\leq a \\leq 1$."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$animated["julia_segment"])
```

Let’s take this opportunity to remember "the most remarkable formula in mathematics", the [Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula):

$$
e^{i x} = \cos x + i \sin x, \quad \text{for any } x \in \mathbb{R}
$$
When $x = \pi$, 

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

A beautiful identity as it contains five of the most fundamental numbers in Mathematics.
Let $c = r e^{i \theta}$, then

$$
\begin{cases}
  \mathrm{Re}(c) = r \cos{\theta} \\
  \mathrm{Im}(c) = r \sin{\theta}
\end{cases}
$$

which is a circumference in the complex plane, thus connecting trigonometry and complex numbers.
Figure \@ref(fig:julia-circumference) shows Julia sets for a counter-clockwise rotation around a circumference $r e^{i \theta}$.

```{r julia-circumference, fig.link=fig_links$animated["julia_circumference"], fig.cap="Julia sets $J_c(f)$ around the circumference $c = 0.7885 e^{i \\theta}$ in the complex plane."}
knitr::include_graphics(fig_links$animated["julia_circumference"])
```

## Final notes

Fractal shapes can be seen in Nature like in a humble [cauliflower](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/science/cauliflower-fractals.html),
but they are also applied in technology, as [fractal antennas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_antenna),
or in explaining [considerable differences in coastline length measurements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox).

Aside from its applications, I think fractals are just pretty neat. I mean, look at this:

To close, my recommendation of a couple of videos from amazing YouTube channels to dive more into fractals.
